### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use **Flexbox** to center content both vertically and horizontally.
- How to apply **padding and margins** to control spacing within a card.
- How to use css to match a design
  -How to deploy a project using **Vercel**.

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem;
}

### Continued development

-I would want to try to rebuild this with Tailwind
-I would also like to experiment with animations

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) - This helped me when using the css components and styling the card in different styles with pixels and paddings.
- Some fo the information onnthe Readme and stylr-guide from the frontendmentor pages helped as well .
